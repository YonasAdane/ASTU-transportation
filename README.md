# ASTU-transportation
This is a simple ASTU transportation system made for bus drivers, administrators, and staff at ASTU. Employees are transported to their residences by bus from the university. This system assists staff members in choosing the bus that travels along their routes. Administrators can also use it to delete buses from the system and add new ones, as well as update bus information like driver changes.
I used linkedlist data structure to store bus information.
